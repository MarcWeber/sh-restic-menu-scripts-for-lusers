Make making backups with restic that easy that everybody can do it by starting
or clicking on a script (.bat or .sh)

I'd love to see such feature be integrated in the main repository eg by using a
.json configuration.

[See Github issue](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/5479#issuecomment-3255715448)

luser = user + looser (like anybody who doesn't want to spend time on
documentation :-) I tried translating DAU into English
In this case its actually meant positive as in spend as much time only as is
required to get a job done ..
